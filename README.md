# Book Search:book:
### RESTful API :arrow_right: GraphQL API
## Purpose:heavy_exclamation_mark:
 To take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.<br>

### USER STORY:
`"AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase"` 


When running `npm start`, the first page showed this:
